This project consists in the automation of the deployment of new subnets in a completely 
unattended way to give connectivity to the network servers connected in the Cisco ACI SDN network. 
This automation will participate in a supply chain of both physical and virtual servers, and will generate 
the necessary subnets for each new system (set of servers with the same function) entering the SDN network 
to provide network connectivity. The automation will create all the necessary elements in the ACI network 
such as tenants, bridge domains, EPG's, will validate that the objects have been created correctly and that 
at network infrastructure level everything is correctly configured, operational and without impact.
